This repo is for a project contracted by WizeView. The project is a computer-vision-based elderly fall risk assessment application.

This project is adapted from the pose detection algorithm offered by Mediapipe.

fall-assessment-integrated.py runs a demo interface, and notebook-fall-assessment-software-only.ipynb is a simplified version of it.
